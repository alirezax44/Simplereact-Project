This is a simple React project with styles built using Tailwind CSS. It includes two basic practice projects:

1. Stopwatch: A simple stopwatch application to track time with start, stop, and reset functionality.


2. To-Do List: A basic to-do list app where users can add and remove tasks.



The project showcases the use of React for building interactive user interfaces, along with Tailwind CSS for clean and responsive design.
